This module expands upon Dice So Nice! giving the user the ability to select unique dice for any item.
This module aims to provide the ability to roll unique dice for many of the document types (actor, item, roll table, etc.). Currently only functional with `dnd5e` and items.

To use this module, you will need to save your dice appearance through Dice So Nice!, this can be found in Dice So Nice module settings: `My Dice Settings> Backup & Restore`.
Once saved, edit your item. You will see 'Dice Set' at the top of the window, selecting this will present a dialog for you to select the set you wish to use for this item.
